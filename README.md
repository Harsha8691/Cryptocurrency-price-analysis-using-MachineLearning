CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICE ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING

OVERVIEW

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict cryptocurrency prices. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

FEATURES

Data Collection    : Fetches cryptocurrency historical data from APIs or CSV files.
Data Preprocessing : Cleans and preprocesses data, handling missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Generates relevant features like moving averages, volatility indicators, etc.
Model Training     : Implements various machine learning models (e.g., regression, time series forecasting) for price prediction.
Evaluation         : Evaluates models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and visualizes predictions vs. actual prices.
